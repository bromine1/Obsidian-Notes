# Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory [VESPER]

- model in chemistry
- predicts the shape of individual molecules
- Based on minimizing the extent of electron-pair repulsion around the central atom being considered

---

- most electronegative atom is the central atom - the one that wants electrons the most (which one is closest to fluorine)

- Water is called bent
  - Shared electrons want to be as far away as possible
  - unshared pairs want to be as far away as they can from shared pairs
