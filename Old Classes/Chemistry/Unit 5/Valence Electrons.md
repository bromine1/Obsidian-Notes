# Valence Electrons



### Overview & Review

- **<u>Valence electrons</u>** are electrons in the <u>**Outermost**</u> orbit
  - The Highest Principal energy limit
  - The Group number corresponds to the number of electrons in A groups
    - This **<u>DOES NOT WORK</u>** With Transition metals
- Ions
  - Cation - take an electron from a metal
  - Anion - add an electron to a nonmetal

### Electron Dot Structures

- element symbols surrounded by dots
- sometimes called Lewis Dot Structures
- See Chem Notebook pg 12 for examples *Figures A, B, C *
- How to write
  - Normal
    - Start at noon(top)
    - Go Clockwise
    - Count electrons in the highest group
  - Ions
    - 1-3 Valence electrons - Lose electrons
    - 4 Valence electrons - Gain or Lose electrons
    - 5-7 Valence electrons - Gain electrons
    - Drop or add enough to make **<u>8</u>** valence electrons
    - Examples of atom to ion in notebook pg 12

## Bonding: The Why

- Every atom wants to be a **<u>Noble Gas</u>** (8 electrons)
- they want to be the **<u>Closest</u>** noble gas
- They will only ever be a <u>**pseudo noble gas**</u> 
- Elements are willing to wrap around to become this
  - eg Potassium (K) moving up to Argon (Ar)
