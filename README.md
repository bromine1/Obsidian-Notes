# Obsidian-Notes
Hi, if you know me you know me
This is a set of rudimentary notes for my classes. I'm a big fan of FOSS stuff, and figured since I don't write software, why don't I open source my notes?
*it also conveniently allows me to sync them across devices but shhhhhhhhh*

These notes, in theory, aren't necessarily mine. They're ours, and I hope others feel free to contribute to them. I am simply watching and moderating the flow of these notes as I contribute my own. If this ever grows beyond me I can fork it and leave it up to anyone.

Most of my notes are written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/ "Markdown website and guide"). One should note that markdown is a widely used language implemented in a lot of different ways. The interpreter or writer you use may be different than [mine](https://obsidian.md/ "Obsidian"), even if you are using the same program due to plugins. I'll try to keep up a wiki of what I use, but Im not entirely sure how well i'll keep up with it.


If for some reason you come across this and don't know me personally, Hello! This is my first github project, and really a way for me to learn it while sharing my passion for Open Source, seeing as I don't know much code. If you have any tips or reccomendation on how I can improve my documentation (or the contents of my notes), please give a feature request in the issues section.
