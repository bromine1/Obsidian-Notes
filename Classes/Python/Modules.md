# What Are Modules?
In python, **Modules** are simply **.py files** that contain defined python code. These modules can be referenced with the `import` function.

# Where do Modules Come From?
Some modules are built in, such as `math.[function]`. However, other modules must be installed. Python uses `pip` to do this.
## What is Pip?
`pip` is a **package manager** for python. It manages installed modules so that every time you `import` you don't have to download a package. It gets these modules from the [Python Pacakge Index](https://pypi.org). `pip` can be used to install pacakges from that **repository**.
