## What are Functions
### Function Effects
Functions are a part of computer code that can do the following:
- **impart an effect**: A function could "send text to the terminal, create a file, draw an image, play a sound, etc."
- **Evaluate a Value**: functions can perfrom mathematical equations, and then return the value as the result of the function
### Where do They Come From?
Functions in Pytho can come from **3** places:
- **Python itself**: these are baked in functions such as `print()` or `help()` that python provides
- **Addon Modules**: Python has a system of **[[Modules]]** that one can obtain using `import` if you have them installed, or `pip` if you need to install them.
- **Created Functions**: functions can be defined useinf the `def` function, which allows you to make your own function. These functions can then accpet input and provide output based on what **you** put in them. They can then be referred to later.
### Functions are named how they are for a reason
In Python, functionsa are named to be **Human Readable**. you know that `print()` will print to the terminal, or that `if` says if this then that. Names are **Significant** in python, as they show what the function does.
