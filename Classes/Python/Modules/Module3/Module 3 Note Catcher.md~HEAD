<!--- Hi, if you're reading this, then Welcome! You're here for  of 2 reasons:
1. You're just seeing this in plaintext, which means you opend the file in a text editor. This is intended to be used with my Obsidian setup, which has it's own extensiosn to give my notes *flair*
2.  You're here for the author's commentary! All of my things that are commented are little snarky notes, annectdotes, and jokes I make that people studying probably don't need.
In any case, go forth, be good, and I'll see you whenever I do. --->
