# Lambda Functions
- if you don't get them after this, check [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp)
- Lambda functions are a way of writing functions on one line
- The syntax for lamba functions look like this:
`lambda arguments: function`

## But Why?
- lambda functions serve as a great tool for building other functions.
- [This](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_lambda_double) is a great example
	- The function takes an argument, but also has more undefined options
	- The creation of `mydoubler` defines this option, with `myfunc` defining the amount to multiply as by 2
	- The new function can take an argument and now double it
- This could easily be done with 3, 4, or whatever other number you want.
- In this way you write less code. Think of making a calculator, for example. This would be useful.
