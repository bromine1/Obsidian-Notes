# Vector Lists
- vector lists are a way of comparing numbers against other items of a similar index
- faster and easier to read than for loops
- needs `numpy` as far as I can tell, so you'll have to use [replit](https://replit.com/)

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(x*2)
# returns [ 2  4  6  8 10]
```
