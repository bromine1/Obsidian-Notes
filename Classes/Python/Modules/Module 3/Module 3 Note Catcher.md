<!--- Hi, if you're reading this, then Welcome! You're here for  of 2 reasons:
1. You're just seeing this in plaintext, which means you opend the file in a text editor. This is intended to be used with my Obsidian setup, which has it's own extensiosn to give my notes *flair*
2.  You're here for the author's commentary! All of my things that are commented are little snarky notes, annectdotes, and jokes I make that people studying probably don't need.
In any case, go forth, be good, and I'll see you whenever I do. --->

# Module 3: [Logic](./Topics/Logic.md), Booleans, and [Lists](./Topics/Lists.md)

## [Logic](./Topics/Logic.md) - Conditional  Statements
- The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements take Comparisson operators. If they return true, the execute their code. This allows your program to make rudimentary decisions. The functions are detailed more 

### [Comparison Operators](./Topics/Logic.md#Comparison-Operators)
- Comparison operators take data and compare them. If the desired Outcome is reached, they return true
- Can comapre multiple data types

## Syntax
- The rules that dicate if code is correct
- each program has it's own
- think of it like grammar for code

## Booleans
- Booleans are a data type in python that can only be `True` or `False`
- Many functions take booleans and manipulate them to determine how they should act
