# Keep in Mind

### Everything

- Are the Charges Balanced
- Are the reactants and products balanced

### SR Exceptions
```ad-info
title: Exception

Alkali metals, when mixing with water, create a hydroxide(OH), such as the following:

$$
\begin{array}

 \text{Li} + H_2O \rightarrow \\
 Li+H_2O \rightarrow LiOH + H_2 \\
2 Li+2H_2O \rightarrow 2LiOH + H_2\\

\end{array}
```

```ad-info
title: Does it Occur?

Check your reference sheet. Do the switching elements have precedence over the other? If so, then the reaction occurs
```
### DR Exceptions
```ad-info
title: Solubility

Check your solubility rules. Does the reaction create a gas, water, precipitate, or is it still aqueous? If both are still aqueous, then the reaction doesn't occur

```

### Acids
```ad-info
title: Acid Rules

- Acids end in ic our ous
- Acids are Hydrogen balancing out the ions, polyatomic or not, with a neutral charge
