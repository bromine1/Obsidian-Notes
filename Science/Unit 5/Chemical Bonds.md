# Chemical Bonds

- Bonds result from the attraction of nuclei for electrons

  - Everything is trying to receive a <u>Stable Octet</u>

- In other words

  - $$
    \text {The } p^+ \text { in one element is attracted to the } e^- \text {of another atom}
    $$

  - Electro negativity

## 2 Major types of bonding (and one minor type)

### Ionic Bonding

- Bonding together cations and Anions
- Forms ionic <u>Compounds</u>
- Transfer of e (electrons)
- Write the simplest repeating part of the crystalline structure

#### Describing Ionic Bonds

- Crystalline structure

### Covalent Bonding

- forms <u>molecules</u> (Baldwin is going to be a stickler for vocabulary)
  - Only a molecule if its covalent bonding
- Sharing Electrons between atoms
- Whole thing is the "simplest" bond

#### Describing Covalent Bonds

- Molecules have structure
  - Caffeine looks like eldritch spaghetti Atoms

##### Minor Bonding: Metallic Bonding

- occurs between like atoms of a metal in a free state
- Valence electrons are mobile (move freely among metal atoms)
- positive ions are in a sea of electrons
- gives us our metallic characteristics
  - high mp temps
  - ductile
  - malleable
  - shiny
  - hard
  - good conductors of heat and electricity

## Bonding

### Ionic bonding (Compounds)

- Electrons are <u>transferred</u> between <u>Valence Shells</u> of atoms
- Charges will **<u>ALWAYS</u>** result in a neutral charge
- made of ions

$$
e⁺ \text { anions } e⁻ \text { cations and there are polyions} 
$$



- Called <u>Salts</u> and <u>Crystals</u> 
- **<u>ALWAYS</u>** between Metals and Nonmetals
  - Fingers should be far apart
  - opposite sides of the metalloid line
- Electronegativity difference must be <u>>2.0</u>
  - Look up the e-neg of the atoms int he bond and subtract smallest from largest
- <u>Compounds</u> with polyatomic ions
  - Polyatomic ions are molecules we treat as anions and cations for the purpose of ionic bodning
    - Sulfates
    - Ammonium

#### Properties of Ionic Compounds

- Hard solids @ 22°C
- High Melting Point Temperatures
- Nonconductors of electricity in <u>Solid</u> phase
- **Good** conductors in liquid phase or dissolved in water (aqueous)
- In order for ionic compounds to react they need to be moving (already content)
  - Heated up
  - Dissolved in water

### Covalent bonding (Molecules)

- <u>Pairs</u> of electrons are <u>Shared</u> between <u>non-metal</u> atoms
- Electronegativity *difference* < <u>2.0</u>

#### Properties of Molecular Substances

- Low mp temp and hp temp
- Relatively <u>Soft Solids</u> compared to ionic compounds
- nonconductors of electricity under  <u>ANY</u> phase

### Covalent, Ionic, or metallic?

- Covalent spread apart, Ionic Close together
- Covalent <2.0 e-neg,  Ionic > 2.0
