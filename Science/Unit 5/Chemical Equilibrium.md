Remmebr, equilibrium does NOT meant that things have stopped. In equilibrium, things are swapping around in balance

### Converting Moles

- Periodic table tells you one mole of an atom in grams
	- Measure of grams is equal to 1 mole 

```ad-example
title: Mols to grams

$$
\begin{array}
\text {1 mol of }CO_2\\
1(C) x 12.011 = 12.011\\
2(O) x 15.999 = 31.998\\
31.998+15.999 = \frac {44.009g} {mol}
\text{So there are 44.009 g in 1 mol of } CO_2
\end{array}
$$
```

```ad-example
title: mols to grams

How many grams in 1 mol of Potassium Phosphate?
$$
\begin{array}
k_3PO_4\\
\text{How many grams in 1 mol of }k_3PO_4\\
3(k) * 39.098 = 117.294\\
1(P) * 30.974 = 30.974\\
4(O) * 15.999 = 63.996\\
117.294 + 30.974 + 63.996 = \frac {212.264g} {mol}\\
\text{So there are 212.264 g in 1 mol of } CO_2
\end{array}
$$
```

```ad-example
title: How many mols are in x grams?

How many mols are in 456 grams of oxygen

$$
\frac {456g} {\frac {44.009g} {\text{mol}}} = 10.36 \text { mols}
$$
```

```ad-example
title: How many grams are in x mols?

How many mols are in 8.3 mols of Potassium Phosphate

$$
8.3 * \frac {212.264} {mol} = 1.8 * 10^3 \text {grams}
$$
```

### Avogadro's Constant
```ad-example

```


```ad-example
how many liters of nitrogen gas is 35.6 mols at STP

$$
\begin{array}
STP = \frac {22.4L} {mol}
22.4 * 35.6 = 797 L N_{2(g)}
\end{array}
$$
```

---
- Coefficients give us the Moles of each reactant and product

```ad-example
$$
MgCl_2 + 2NaOH \rightarrow Mg(OH)_2 + 2NaCl
$$
- we can use these number to get Mole Ratios
- So we have 2 moles of sodium hydroxide to 1 mole  of magnesium hydroxid

$$
\frac {2mol NaOH} {1 mol Mg(OH)_2}
$$

- 1 Mole of Magnesium chloride to 2 moles of sodium chloride

$$
\frac {1 mol MgCl_2} {2 mol NaCl}
$$
- 1 Mole of Sodium Hydroxide to 1 Mole of Sodium Chloride

$$
\frac {1 mol Na(OH)} {1 mol NaCl}
$$
```

### Chemical Equilibrium
- most chemical reaction reach a state of amking chemical equilibrium
	- Most aren't just one arrow making a single products
- Products may turn back into reactants
	- We call these reversable reactions

```ad-example
$$
\begin{array}
A+B \rightarrow C+D\\
C+D \rightarrow A+B\\
\end{array}
$$
```
- When talking about equilibrium we're talking about concentrations of things
- When we start out, we have 0 product![[Pasted image 20211202120342.png]]
- Equilibrium is reaached at around 0.5 seconds
	- DOES NOT STOP
- Equilibrium is writted with 2 arrows. For the purpose of I can't do this, this is a double arrow here

#### Calculating equilibrium constant expressions (known as a Keq)
- can be written as the following

$$
\begin{array}
aaA + bB \leftrightarrow cC + dD \\
k_{eq} = \frac {[C]^c * [D]^d} {[A]^a * [B]^b}
\end{array}
$$
- This equation is sometimes called the **Mass-Action Expression**
- This is the Products over the Reactants
- The power symbols is the coefficient

```ad-example
title: Mass-Action Expression

$$
\begin{array}
2SO_3 \leftrightarrow 2SO_2 + O_2\\
K_{eq} = \frac {[SO_2]^2[O_2]^2} {[SO_3]^2}
\end{array}
$$
```

```ad-example
title: Mass-Action Expression

$$
\begin{array}
2KClO_3 \leftrightarrow 2KCl + 3O_2\\
K_{eq} = \frac {[O_2]^3[2KCl]^2} {[KClO_3]^2}
\end{array}
$$
```

#### Le Chatelier's Principal
> "If a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will change to relieve that sress and re-establish equilibrium"

- Think of the undo button on your computer
```ad-note
title: Factors that Affect Equilibrium

- Concentration
- temperature
- Pressure
	- for gaseous systems only
- The presence of a catalyst
```
##### Number Changes
![[Pasted image 20211202122309.png]]
- To reestablish equilibrium, the hydrogen will break up from the oxygen in the products to give 2 H_2 back to the reactants
- Think as if you are balancing an equation. They are always trying to balance eachother

```ad-note

```

##### Heat

![[Pasted image 20211202123044.png]]
- If you take the heat away from the right, heat will move from the begining of the reaction to the products
- If you add heat to the reaction its going to go abckwards
- Remember, breaking bonds gives energy, creating bonds takes energy

##### Pressure Changes
- Only affect equilibrium system with <u> unequal </u> moles of <u>gaseous</u> reactants and products
- Count the moles, arrow points to the side with less gaseous moles
- ONLY COUNT THE GASEOUS MOLES

![[Pasted image 20211202123531.png]]
- In this image, we are INCREASING
- 4 mols on the left
- 2 mols on the right
- UNEQUAL NUMBER OF MOLES
- Pressure shifts to the right in this example
- The same works in reverse. If you are decreasing pressure, you want the pressure to shift to whatever has MORE moles

##### Presence of a Catalyst
- a catalyst lowerrs the activation energy and increases the reaction rate
- will lower the forward and reverse reaction rate
- has NO EFFECT on a system at equilibrium

N_{2(g)}+3h_{2(g)} \leftrightarrow 2NH_{3(g)}+ 22.0kcal
