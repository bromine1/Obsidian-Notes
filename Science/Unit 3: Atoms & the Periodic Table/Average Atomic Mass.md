# Average Atomic Mass

- The weighted average of atomic masses in natural isotopes of an element

### Molecular Weight

Atomic Mass is the average Atomic Number

AMU - 1 Atomic Mass Unit

- Proton (1 AMU) = Atomic Number

- Electrons (Essentials 0 AMU) - same as the atomic number

- N = Atomic Mass - atomic number

---

### For the Atomic Mass of Carbon

- p = 6

- e = 6

- N = 12-6=6

--- 

# Isotopes

There are multiple ways to write isotopes

- Carbon-12

- Carbon-14

or like this

$$
C^{14}_6
$$

Where the top is the Atomic mass and the bottom is the number of Protons

# Calculating Average Mass Amongst Isotopes

- Take the mass

- multiply by percentage of the mass as a decimal

- repeat for all elements in a system

$$
2.00(.250) = 0.5 \\
3.00(.750) = 2.25 \\
0.5 +2.25 =  2.75\\
\text {Average AMU} = 2.75
