# Atomic Radius



### Radius

- Half the distance between a nuclei in a covalently bonded diatomic molecule
  - Decreases across a period
    - Increased effective nuclear charge due to decreased shielding
  - Radius increases down a group
    - Each row on the periodic table adds a "shell" or energy level to the atom

### Ionizion energy

- Energy required to remove an electron from an atom
  - Increases across a period
    - radius decreases making the pull more effective
  - energy decreases down a group
    - radius increases, making the pull less effective

### Electro negativity

- A measure of the ability of an atom in a chemical compound to attract electrons
- halogens don't have any
  - tends to increase across a period
    - as radius decreases electro negativity increases
  - intends to decrease down a group
    - as radius increases electro negativity decreases

### Ionic Radii

##### Cation

- positively charged ions formed when an atom of a metal loses one or more electrons
  - smaller than the corresponding atom
  - t  is a plus for losing an electron

##### Anions

- negatively charged ions formed when an atom of a nonmetalic ions gain one or more electrons
  - Larger than the corresponding atoms
