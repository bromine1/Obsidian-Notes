# Periodic Table

- Not a static reference- its had many changes, not just additions
- Arranged by atomic number so that elements appear in columns, or groups, with similar qualities.
- Most elements have been known since ancient times, and as such appear in their Latin names

## Period

- Periods are sets of elements organized horizontally
- 7 periods- 1 for each level of electrons

| Period # | # of Elements |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1        | 2             |
| 2        | 8             |
| 3        | 8             |
| 4        | 18            |
| 5        | 18            |
| 6        | 32            |
| 7        | 32            |

- Periods 6 and 7 are usually pulled out for formating

## Group

- Vertical column of a periodic table
- 18 groups total
- 2 different systems

### Traditional

- First 2 groups use 1A and 2A, last sixe groups are 3A-8A. 

### Newer Model

- Just uses 1-18 to avoid confusion.

I feel pretty good about the lesson, its rather straightforward.
