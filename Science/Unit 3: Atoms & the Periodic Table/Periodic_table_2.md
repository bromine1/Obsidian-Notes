# Periodic Table - Its a tool

## People

###### Dmitri Mendeleev 

- Chemical properties repeat after a few elements
- Allowed us to predict unknown elements and their properties
- ordered periodic table by increasing mass

###### Henry Moseley

- Arranged the table by increasing atomic number, or the number of protons
- organizing things by 8 -  law of octaves

## Periodic Table

- Periods are horizontal
- groups are vertical

### Physical Properties

|                       Metals                        |                   Non-Metals                   |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|       Good Conductors of electricity and heat       |    Poor conductors of heat and electricity     |
| Ductile - can be stretched into water, or malleable |                  Non ductile                   |
|              Possess "metallic luster"              |        Doesn't possess metallic luster         |
|   Solid at room temperature (except Hg(Mercury))    | solids, liquids, and gases at room temperature |

### Groups

##### Alkaline Metals - Period 1

- Usually soft
- **Very** reactive
- usually stored under an oil, such as kerosene to prevent it from reacting

##### Alkaline Earth Metals - Period 2

- Not as soft as Alkaline metals, but still soft
- React more mildly
- only react with water when the water is at temperatures that would make it steam

##### Boron Family - Period 13

##### Carbon Family - Period 14 

##### Nitrogen Family - Period 15

##### Oxygen Family - Period 16

##### Halogens - Period 17 - NOT FUN, NOT PLAYTHINGS

- non-metals
- Strong and unpleasant odor
- burns flesh
- Don't dissolve well in water
- reacts with most metals and many non metals

##### Noble or Inert gases - Period 18

- Under normal conditions, noble gases don't play with other elements. not that they don't play nicely, they just don't play. No interaction unless we make the bonds under normal conditions

- Not reactive
- Very Stable

##### Transition metals - 3-12

- everyday metals
- properties of the metals as listed earlier

##### Inner Transition Metals - That whole thing of 2 rows on the bottom

- Rare in nature: everything past 92 protons is man made
- all solids
- similar across the period rather than down the group

### Tidbits

- Francium is our most reactive metal
- Florine is our most reactive nonmetal
- Under normal conditions, noble gases don't play with other elements. not that they don't play nicely, they just don't play. No interaction unless we make the bonds under normal conditions
