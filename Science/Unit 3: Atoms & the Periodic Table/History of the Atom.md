# History of the Atom

---

## People

---

#### Democritus

- really old guy
- First recorded man who thought of the atom as we know it today
- coined the term "atmos" - invisible units
- Believed that if we kept dividing things we would eventually get to one final unit
- The hard, indestructible ball model

---

### John Dalton "The Father of Chemistry"

- Compared individual atoms and their interactions
- created The Atomic Theory of Matter
- Hard, indestructible ball model

--- 

## J.J. Thomson

- Discovered Electrons; lead to the discovery of protons and neutrons

- Cathode Ray Tube experiment

- Plumb Pudding model

- mass of an electron is 1/1860th the mass of a hydrogen atom, or 1 proton

--- 

### Ernest Rutherford

- Discovered the Nucleus
  
  - the small, dense center containing *ALL* the mass
  
  - If the Nucleus was a grape, the rest of the atom would be the size of a football stadium

- Gold foil experiment

--- 

### Niels Bohr

- Electrons have 7 possible enrgy levels

- Bright line Spectra

- Planetary model that we learned in middle school
  
  - Only works for hydrogen

## Concepts

--- 

## Atomic Theory of Matter

---

### 1

- all elements are composed of tiny, individual particles called atoms
  
  - Not True - we can split the Atom

---

### 2

- Atoms of the same element are identical
  
  - almost true - there are ions and isotopes

---

### 3

- The atoms of any one element are different from those of any other element

---

### 4

- Atoms of different elements can ***Chemically Combine*** with one another in simple *Whole Number* Ratios to form **Compounds**

- These elements combine and have new properties

- think of something like H2O. 2 Hydrogen atoms to 1 Oxygen atom is the ration

---

### 5

- Chemical reactions occur when the Atoms are separated, joined, or rearranged

---

### 6

- Atoms of one element are never changed into atoms of another element as a result of chemical reactions
  
  - Not necessarily true, nuclear reactions can result in the *transmutation* of one element into another

---

### Quantum mechanics

- Various Scientists

- Electron's exact location/motion is unknown. We use probability to determine where it might be in an energy field

- Double-Slit experiment

- Quantum Mechanic Model
