Water, Icea, Steam, plasma (?)

As water heats up the molecules excite, changing from ice to liquid to gas.
As water cools down the molecules slow down and crystalize, going from a gas to a liquid to a solid

vaporization: liquid to gas
condensation: gas to liquid
melting: solid to liquid
freezing: liquid to solid
sublimation: solid to gas
deposition: gas to solid



Eneregy is absorbed as the liquid needs more energy to move more freely as gas or to move from a solid to a liquid. This extra movement requires more heat, which is more energy

Potential energy = stored energy
Kinetic energy = energgy of motion

Heat of Fusion - the amount of heat needed to change a solid to a liquid at a constant temperature
Heat of Vaporization - the amount of heat needed to change a liquid to a gas at constant temperature

When you have a phase change, there is no temperature change
