# Chemical Bonding 

**How can we better understand chemical equations by analyzing the relationships between atoms, reactants, and products?**



#### Chemical reactions in Donesty, Ukraine

- Cars burning gas
- Photosynthesis
- Metabolization
- oxygen breathing

### Law of conservation of mass

- Matter cannot be created or destroyed
- This applies of chemical reactions
- mass of reactants must be equal to the mass of the products
- Equations are merely rearranging atoms

### Parts of the Chemical Equation

- A process of substances changing into other substances
- Substances that start a reaction are called reactants
- substances that are produced are called products
- Can be elements or compounds
- Structured as follows:

$$
\text {reactants} \rightarrow \text{products}
$$

- May occur quickly or slowly
- Chemical bonds are breaking and forming in the process
- There are a few kinds of reactions:

| **Type of Reaction** | **General Equation**                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Synthesis            | A+B → C                                |
| Decomposition        | AB → A + B                             |
| Single Replacement   | A+BC → B+ AC                           |
| Double Replacement   | AB+ CD → AD + CB                       |
| Combustion           | fuel + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water |

- Chemical reactions require <u>Energy</u> to occur
  - Breaking bonds requires energy
  - forming bonds releases energy
- Exothermic reactions release energy, as the bonds require less energy to break than it does to form the energy
  - Released oftentimes as heat or light
- Endothermic: more energy is used to break the bonds than is used to form them.
  - Absorbs energy from the environment

### Examples

An unbalanced equation is given. Balance it.
$$
\begin{align}
\text {Balance: }P+O_2 \rightarrow P_4O_{10}\\
\text {answer: } {4P} + {5O_2} \rightarrow {P_4O_{10}}
\end{align}
$$

---

$$
\begin{align}
{AgF} + {CaCl_2} \rightarrow {AgCl} + {CaF_2}\\
{2AgF} + {CaCl_2} \rightarrow 2{AgCl} + {CaF_2}
\end{align}
$$

---

Say how many of each kind of atom are in the chemical
$$
\begin{align}
3Mg_3(PO_4)_2\\
Mg: 9\\
P: 6\\
O: 24
\end{align}
$$
