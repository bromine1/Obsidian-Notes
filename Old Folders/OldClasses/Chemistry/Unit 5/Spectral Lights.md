# Spectroscopy

Light can be split into its different combination with a spectrometer like raindrops with a rainbow

- There are 3 types of spectrum:
  - Continuum Spectrum - All connected light, smoothly transitions from one to the next
  - Emission Line Spectrum: Series of colored lines amidst darkness
  - Absorption Line Spectrum: Series of black lines amidst a continuum Spectrum
- If there is nothing between you and the source, you will get an emission spectrum
- If the "source" of light is behind a cool gas, you will get an absorption spectrum

Each element has a **unique** light spectrum. If a source has 2 of these elements, their spectrum will combine to display both at once
