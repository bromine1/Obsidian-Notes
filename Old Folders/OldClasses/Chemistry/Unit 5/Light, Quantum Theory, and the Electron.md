# Light, Quantum Theory, and the Electron

- Bohr Model
- Solve light and Energy Problems
- We can now measure in zeptoseconds, or 1^-21 seconds

---
### Models of the Atom
- a model should explain what something is made of and how it should behave
- Rutherford's atomic model couldn't explain chemical properties
---
### Bohr Model
---
##### History of the Bohr Model
- Niels Bohr (1885-1962)
  - Danish Physicist
  - Student of Rutherford's

- In 1913 Bohr introduced his model based on Hydrogen
  - Proposed that electrons are only found in specific circular paths, or *orbits*, around the nucleus
---
##### Application of the Bohr model

######  Ground State vs Excited State
  - Ground state has an electron only in the first shell
  - Excited state has an electron only in the 2nd shell
- Electrons don't want to be excited, they will return to grounded
- Electron, when returning to the ground state, will release energy
  - We perceive this as light
###### Energy levels
- Each electron has a fixed energy level
  - Electrons can jump from one energy level to another
  - Electrons ***CANNOT*** exist between energy levels
- A *Quantum* of energy is the amount of energy needed to move an electron from one energy level to another


- You only see light when the energy is released
- Think of color energy in ROY G BIV
- 3 -> 2 is a or read
  - Beginning of ROY G BIV
  - Remember redshift
- 2 -> 1 is b or green
  - green is the middle of ROY G BIV
- 3 -> 1 is C, or blue
  - Has the most energy released, look at the wave
  - also moves the most

The *Degree* to which they move from *level to level* determines the *Frequency* of the *light* they give off

###### Wavelength Refresh

- **Wavelength**: λ (Lambda) is the distance between identical points on successive waves (peaks or troughs) 
- **Frequency**: ν (Nu) the number of waves that pass a particular point in 1 second
- **Amplitude**: The vertical distance from the mid line of waves to the top of the peak or the bottom of the trough

Think of a Rope being swayed along the ground
- High Wavelengths means low frequency
- Low Wavelength means high frequency
For later, ***REVIEW ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM***



- A has
  - Medium Wavelength
  - Medium Amplitude
  - Medium Frequency
- B has 
  - Small wavelength
  - medium amplitude
  - high frequency
- C has
  - very small wavelength
  - medium amplitude
  - very high frequency

### Electron Equations for Wavelengths

$$
c =λν
$$
c = 3.0*10^8 m/s

λ = wavelength (In **METERS**)

ν = frequency (reciprocal seconds, s^-1)

##### Nanometer

$$
_{nm} = 1*10^{-9}m \\
623.8m = ?_{nm}\\
623.8m = {6.238*10^{11}}_{nm}
$$



-----

##### Example Problems

The Wavelength of a laser pointer is reported to be 663 nm. What is the frequency of this light?

**nm to m** 
$$
663 _{nm} = ?m \\
663 _{nm} * 10^{-9} = ?m \\
663 _{nm} = 6.63*10^{-7}m \\
ν = \frac {c} {λ} \\
\frac {3.0*10^{8} \frac m s}  {6.63 * 10^{-7}m } = 4.52*10^{14}s^{-1}
$$


---

Calculate the wavelength of light, in nm, of light with a frequency of:
$$
3.52*10^{-14}s^{-1} \\
λ =\frac c ν\\
λ = \frac {3.0 * 10^8} {3.52 *10^{14}}\\
λ = 8.53*10^{-7}m\\
λ = 853 _{nm}
$$

# Quantum Theory

### People

##### Max Planck

- 1900
- Radiant energy could only be emitted or absorbed in **discrete** quantities
- Quantum - A packet of energy, specifically the amount of energy needed to move an electron from one shell to another
- Correlated data from blackbody experiments to his quantum theory
- Revolutionized how we think about energy (energy is quantized)

---

### Vocab

- **Quantum** - A packet of energy, specifically the amount of energy needed to move an electron from one shell to another
  - Absorbs 12 units of energy, lets off 12 units of energy
- **photons** (packets of light energy)
- **Threshold Frequency** the amount of energy needed to move an electron up a shell
- **Duality, The dual nature of light** - Light exists as both a particle and a wave

- **Line Spectra** - Emission of light only at specific wavelengths

---

### The Actual Theory

##### Energy Theory

$$
E = H\nu\\
E = \text {energy (in joules)}\\
h = \text {plank's constant } 6.63*10^-34J*s\\
\nu = frequency
$$

This works well
$$
C = \lambda \nu\\
E = h\nu\\
\nu = \frac c \lambda \\
E = h \frac c \lambda
$$

---

### Photoelectric effect

- Electrons ejected from a metal's surface when exposed to light of a certain frequency
- Einstein proposed that particles of light are really **photons** (packets of light energy) and deduced that:

$$
E_{photon} = h\nu
$$

- Light of at least the threshold frequency **and** of greater intensity will eject *more* electrons

---

Calculate the energy (in Joules) of a photon with a wavelength of 700.0 nm
$$
E = h \frac c \lambda\\
h = 6.63*10^-34J*s\\
c = 3.0 * 10^8\\
\lambda = 700.0*10^{-9}\\
\lambda = 7E^-7\\
\frac {3.0 * 10^8} {7E^-7}6.63*10^-34J*s = 2.841\\
E = 2.841*10^{-19} \text {joules}
$$

---

### Photoelectric Effect

- Dilemma caused by this theory - is light a wave or a particle?
  - Conclusion: light must have particle characteristics as well as wave characteristics

#### Atomic Line Spectra

- **Line Spectra** - Emission of light only at specific wavelengths
- Every element has a unique emission spectrum
- often referred to as "fingerprints" of the elements
