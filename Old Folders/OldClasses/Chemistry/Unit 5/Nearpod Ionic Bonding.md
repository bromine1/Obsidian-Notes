# Ionic Bonding

## Prelude

- Does the sea have salt in it?
  - Yeah, but not as salt, its all dissolved in the water
- Most rocks and minerals are just a lot of positive and negative ions

## Attraction and Bonding

- Oppositely charged particles pull on each other
  - called <u>electrostatic force</u>
  - and <u>Ionic Bond</u> is the implementation of that force holding together ions in a <u>Compound</u>
- Strength is dependent on 2 factors
  - <u>Directly proportional</u> to number of charges
  - <u>Inversely Proportional</u> to the distance between charged particles
- Ions seek to reach a <u>Noble Gas Configuration</u>
  - 8 valence electrons
  - Composed of <u>Cations</u> and <u>Anions</u>
  - trade electrons around to do this
  - Done between a metal and a nonmetal
- You may sometimes need multiple cations for one anion, or multiple anions for one cation such as with the example below for magnesium chloride

$$
\text {Mg}^{+2} + \text  { Cl}^- \rightarrow \text {Mg} \text  {Cl}_2
$$
