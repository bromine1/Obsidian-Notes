# Keep in Mind

### Everything

- Are the Charges Balanced
- Are the reactants and products balanced

### SR Exceptions
```ad-info
title: Exception

Alkali metals, when mixing with water, create a hydroxide(OH), such as the following:

$$
\begin{array}

 \text{Li} + H_2O \rightarrow \\
 Li+H_2O \rightarrow LiOH + H_2 \\
2 Li+2H_2O \rightarrow 2LiOH + H_2\\

\end{array}
```

```ad-info
title: Does it Occur?

Check your reference sheet. Do the switching elements have precedence over the other? If so, then the reaction occurs
```
### DR Exceptions
```ad-info
title: Solubility

Check your solubility rules. Does the reaction create a gas, water, precipitate, or is it still aqueous? If both are still aqueous, then the reaction doesn't occur

```

### Acids
```ad-info
title: Acid Rules

- Acids are Hydrogen balancing out the ions, polyatomic or not, with a neutral charge
```
```ad-info
title: Acid Naming

- Acids end in ic our ous
	- Ends in ic if the ending is ate or ide
	- Ends in ous if the ending is ite

For Example:
$$
\begin{align}
H_2 \underline {SO_4} \text { is sulpheric Acid}\\
H_2 \underline {SO_3} \text { is sulpherous Acid}
\end{align}
$$
```

### Ionic Bonds
```ad-info
title: Naming

Name of the Metal, then the non metal with an ide ending

$$
\text {sodium and chlorine} \rightarrow \text {sodium chloride}
$$

From here you can transfer it to its balanced form. Make sure the charges are balanced

$$
\text {sodium chloride} \rightarrow {NaCl}
```

```ad-info
title: Transition and Staircase Metals

All Transition metals need roman numerals in their named form. This can be implied based on the number in balancing charges, or it will be told to you.

All Transition metals and the following "harry poter metals" (they're under the stiarcase)

- Lead (Pb)
- Tin (Sn)
- Antimony (Sb)
- Bismuth(Bi)

Other exceptions include Zinc and Silver
- Zinc has a +2 Charge
- Silver has a +1 Charge

You can remember this by counting down 2 and 1 from where the transition metals meet everything else
```
